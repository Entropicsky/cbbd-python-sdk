# CFBD Python SDK Architecture

## Overview
The CFBD Python SDK will provide a clean, well-structured, and user-friendly interface for accessing the College Basketball Data API. The SDK will wrap all available endpoints while also providing advanced functionality by combining data from multiple endpoints.

## Design Principles
1. **User-Friendly**: Prioritize ease of use with sensible defaults and clear documentation
2. **Comprehensive**: Cover all available API endpoints
3. **Extensible**: Design for future enhancements and API changes
4. **Reliable**: Include thorough error handling and testing
5. **Performant**: Implement caching and batch processing where appropriate

### Class Hierarchy

#### 1. Client Class
The `CFBDClient` will be the main entry point for users, providing access to all API functionality.

```python
class CFBDClient:
    """Main client for the CFBD API."""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key=None, use_cache=True, cache_ttl=300):
        # Initialize with API key (from env var if not provided)
        # Set up caching if enabled
        # Initialize API endpoint wrappers
        
    # Properties for each API category
    @property
    def teams(self):
        # Return teams API wrapper
        
    @property
    def games(self):
        # Return games API wrapper
        
    # ... other API categories
    
    # Properties for advanced functionality
    @property
    def team_seasons(self):
        # Return team season advanced functionality
        
    # ... other advanced functionality
```

#### 2. Base API Class
All API endpoint wrappers will inherit from a base class that handles common functionality.

```python
class BaseAPI:
    """Base class for API endpoint wrappers."""
    
    def __init__(self, client):
        # Store reference to client for authentication and config
        
    def _request(self, endpoint, params=None):
        # Make authenticated request to API
        # Handle caching
        # Handle errors
        # Return parsed response
```

#### 3. Model Classes
Data returned from the API will be converted into model classes for easier usage.

```python
class BaseModel:
    """Base model class with common functionality."""
    
    def __init__(self, data):
        # Initialize from API data
        
    def to_dict(self):
        # Convert to dictionary
        
    def to_dataframe(self):
        # Convert to pandas DataFrame if pandas is available
```

### Core Functionality

#### Authentication
- API key stored in environment variable (`CFBD_API_KEY`) or provided during client initialization
- Passed as Bearer token in Authorization header for all requests

#### Caching
- Optional in-memory caching of API responses
- Configurable TTL (time-to-live) for cached responses
- Automatic cache invalidation based on TTL
- Cache key generation based on endpoint and parameters

#### Error Handling
- Custom exception classes for different error types
- Informative error messages with context
- Automatic retry for transient errors (e.g., rate limiting)

#### Input Validation
- Validation of required parameters
- Type checking and conversion
- Date format standardization

### Advanced Functionality

#### Team Season Profile
- Combine team information, conference, schedule, stats, and roster for a comprehensive team season view
- Aggregate game-by-game stats into season totals or averages
- Include rankings and advanced metrics

#### Player Career Profile
- Combine player information and stats across multiple seasons
- Show progression and trends over time
- Include advanced metrics and game logs

#### Game Detail
- Combine game information, box scores, play-by-play, and media info
- Provide advanced analysis like player impact and key plays
- Include betting information if available

## HTTP Client Strategy
- Use `requests` library for HTTP requests
- Implement connection pooling for performance
- Handle HTTP errors with appropriate status code responses

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Mock responses for testing without API keys
- Snapshot testing for model classes
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing

## Documentation Strategy
- Comprehensive API reference
- Usage examples for common scenarios
- Tutorials for getting started
- Interactive examples in Jupyter notebooks
- Type hints for code completion in IDEs
