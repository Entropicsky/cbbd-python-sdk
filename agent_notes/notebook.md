# CBBD Python SDK Project Notes

## Debugging and Fixing the Plays Page

### Problem Identification
- The Plays page was showing empty data with "None" values for most fields
- There were two errors:
  1. `'PlaysAPI' object has no attribute 'get_plays_by_game'` - Method name was incorrect
  2. `'Play' object has no attribute 'opponent'` - Attribute didn't exist in the model

### Solution Approach
1. Added debug logging to the API methods to see the raw API response
2. Updated the Play model to handle different field naming conventions (camelCase vs snake_case)
3. Created a "Raw Data Sample" expandable section to show the actual API response data
4. Added a Debug tab to help developers understand the API structure

### Implementation Details
- Fixed method name from `get_plays_by_game` to `get_plays`
- Updated property access in the Play model to fall back to alternative field names
- Added proper error handling with traceback display
- Removed non-existent fields from the DataFrame display
- Added fallback methods for extracting data when fields are missing

## UI Enhancements

### Raw Data Sample Feature
- Added expandable "Raw Data Sample" sections to all pages that make API calls:
  - Teams
  - Games
  - Stats
  - Rankings
  - Ratings
  - Plays
  - Lines
- This feature helps developers understand the structure of the API responses
- Implemented fallbacks when `get_raw_data()` method is not available

### Base Model Improvements
- Created a `BaseModel` class with standardized methods:
  - `get_raw_data()` for exposing the raw API response
  - `to_dict()` for converting to dictionaries
  - `__str__()` for better string representation
  - `get_base_properties()` for customizable string output

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding model-specific debug information to each page
- Add more interactive visualizations for the data
- Improve error messages with hints for fixing common issues
- Provide links to API documentation for each endpoint

## Developer Notes

### SDK Architecture

The SDK is designed with a clean, modular architecture:

- `cbbd/client.py`: Main client class
- `cbbd/api/`: API endpoint implementations
- `cbbd/models/`: Data models for API responses
- `cbbd/advanced/`: Advanced combined endpoints
- `cbbd/utils/`: Utility functions and classes
- `cbbd/exceptions.py`: Custom exception classes
- `cbbd/constants.py`: Constants used throughout the SDK
- `cbbd/transformers/`: Data transformation utilities (new!)

### Important Patterns

1. **Lazy Loading**: API endpoint modules are loaded only when first accessed to reduce startup time and memory usage.

2. **Model Classes**: Each API response is mapped to a model class that provides a clean interface for accessing data.

3. **Raw Data Access**: All model objects provide a `get_raw_data()` method to access the original API response.

4. **Caching**: Responses can be cached to reduce API calls during a session.

5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is available throughout the SDK.

6. **Fluent Interface**: API methods are designed to be chainable where appropriate.

7. **Error Handling**: Custom exception classes provide detailed error information.

8. **Advanced Features**: Combined endpoints that use multiple API calls to provide enhanced functionality.

9. **Data Transformations**: Utility functions to convert API responses to pandas DataFrames (new!)

### New Data Transformation Layer

We've added a comprehensive data transformation layer to the SDK that makes working with the API data much easier. The key components include:

1. **BaseTransformer**: A base class that provides common functionality for all transformers:
   - Handling NULL values (`"NULL"` strings converted to `None`)
   - Extracting values from nested structures
   - Flattening nested dictionaries
   - Converting to numeric types safely
   - Standardized methods for all transformers

2. **Endpoint-Specific Transformers**: 
   - `RosterTransformer`: For team roster data
   - `TeamsTransformer`: For team information
   - `GamesTransformer`: For game data and box scores
   - `PlayersTransformer`: For player information and stats
   - `RankingsTransformer`: For rankings data
   - `RatingsTransformer`: For team ratings
   - `LinesTransformer`: For betting lines
   - `PlaysTransformer`: For play-by-play data

3. **DataFrameUtils**: A utility class for working with DataFrames:
   - Making DataFrames ready for visualization
   - Adding calculated columns
   - Filtering by season, team, etc.
   - Standardizing column names

4. **Client Integration**: The transformers are available through the client instance:
   ```python
   client = CBBDClient()
   # Get data from API
   roster = client.teams.get_roster(team="Duke", season=2023)
   # Transform to DataFrame
   df = client.transformers.roster_to_dataframe(roster)
   ```

### Common Challenges Addressed

The transformation layer addresses several common challenges:

1. **Nested Data**: The API often returns deeply nested structures that are hard to work with in data analysis tools. The transformers flatten these structures.

2. **NULL Values**: The API uses string "NULL" values instead of proper null values. The transformers convert these to proper None/NaN values.

3. **Inconsistent Access Patterns**: Some data needs to be accessed differently depending on the endpoint. The transformers provide a consistent interface.

4. **Type Conversion**: String values are automatically converted to appropriate types (numeric, dates, etc.).

5. **Calculated Fields**: Common calculated fields are automatically added where appropriate (e.g., experience = current_season - start_season).

### API Response Format

API responses follow these general formats:

1. **List of Objects**: Most endpoints return a list of objects with a consistent schema.

2. **Nested Objects**: Some endpoints return objects with nested objects (e.g., games with home and away teams).

3. **Paginated Responses**: Some endpoints support pagination.

4. **Null Values**: The API uses the string "NULL" to represent null values.

### SDK Authentication

Authentication is handled through an API key, which can be provided in several ways:

1. Directly to the client constructor:
   ```python
   client = CBBDClient(api_key="your-api-key")
   ```

2. Through an environment variable:
   ```
   # .env file or export in shell
   CBBD_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

### Implemented Features

The SDK currently covers all available endpoints in the College Basketball Data API:

- Teams and rosters
- Games and schedules
- Player information and statistics
- Rankings
- Ratings
- Plays
- Betting lines
- Venues
- Conferences
- Draft data
- Recruiting information
- Lineups
- Substitutions

### Advanced Features

The SDK provides advanced features that combine multiple API calls:

1. **Team Season Profile**: Comprehensive team data for a season.
2. **Player Season Profile**: Comprehensive player data for a season.
3. **Game Analysis**: Detailed analysis of a game.

### Future Improvements

Areas identified for future work:

1. Complete test coverage
2. More examples
3. Enhanced documentation
4. CLI interface
5. More advanced features
6. PyPI package release
